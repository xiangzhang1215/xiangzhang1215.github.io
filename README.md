## Welcome to my homepage

Hi, I am Xiang Zhang, a senior student in Department of Precision Machinery and Instrumentation, [School of Engineering Science](https://http://en.ses.ustc.edu.cn/), at [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](https://www.ustc.edu.cn/).

Currently, I am a senior research assistant in [Laser Laboratory for Trace Analysis and Precision Measurements](http://atta.ustc.edu.cn/en-us/index.html), supervised by [Prof. Dong Sheng](http://atta.ustc.edu.cn/en-us/members/faculty/dsheng.html).

As a self-motivated student, my rank is 1st out of 60 students in my department with a GPA of 3.91/4.3 and won the GuoMoruo Scholarship which is the highest honor awarded to most excellent undergraduates at USTC.

## Research Experience

### Atomic Devices Lab

I joined [Laser Laboratory for Trace Analysis and Precision Measurements](http://atta.ustc.edu.cn/en-us/index.html) in 2017. In the past two years, I participated in two projects of this lab, which are a Miniaturized Optically-pumped Magnetometer and Data Analysis of GNOME Experiment.

#### Project I: A Miniaturized Optically-pumped Magnetometer

##### Background

##### Shape Design and Manufacture

In this project, we try to build a miniaturized optically-pumped magnrtometer by reducing the size of optical path and using customized small-sized lenses. However, this task is challenging because the distance between the lenses need to be more accurate than common optically-pumped magnrtometers, which requires a thoughful design of the shape and a precise way to fabricate it.

I designed the 3D structure of the magnetometer by SolidWorks and used 3D printing to bring it from design to reality. With a size of 20mm*20mm*25mm, it contains all the lenses, a cubic cell filled with Rb and K, a flexible resistive foil heater for the cell and a PCB to turn light signal to electrical signal. Here are photos of the design and the 3D printed magnetometer.
